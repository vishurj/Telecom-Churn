In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

The model will only be able to achieve one of the two goals

To predict customers who will churn.
You can’t use the above model to identify the important features for churn. That’s because PCA usually creates components which are not easy to interpret.

Therefore, build another model with the main objective of identifying important predictor attributes which help the business understand indicators of churn.

A good choice to identify important variables is a logistic regression model or a model from the tree family. In case of logistic regression, make sure to handle multi-collinearity.

After identifying important predictors, display them visually - you can use plots, summary tables etc. - whatever you think best conveys the importance of features.
